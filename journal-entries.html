<center>  <p> Laurel Schwulst’s article had some amazing takes on the individuality and craftsmanship of the modern website. I enjoyed her stances on how websites should be fashioned in a way that is both personal and patient. I also loved that she made me recognize that the web is always growing and changing and that we as creatives, may be challenged by the modern demands of digital space and place.

<br>
In her article, Schwulst mentions how websites can exist similarly to natural objects and domestic spaces like a room, a shelf, a plant, a garden, a puddle, and even a rock is thrown into the ocean. Defining the purpose of a website in this manner makes websites feel more approachable and comforting, as opposed to automatically associating them with the confusing entanglement of the world wide web. Likewise, Schwulst also mentions that we should embrace the power of the web and its inherent interconnectivity.

<br>
Overall, I felt like Schwult’s article changed my perspective on what a website should look and feel like. It makes me even more excited to utilize her methods and mindset in my first website here in class! </p> </center>
